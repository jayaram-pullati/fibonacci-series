Test Driven Development - Fibonacci Series - NodeJS
Introduction:
A TDD (Test Driven Development) approach for writing the Fibonacci Series, using NodeJS, Mocha, and Chai. This was done by first creating the tests for a feature, then writing the minimum code to pass the tests. The process was repeated for the remaining features.

This exercise requires you to write a NodeJS program to get it to display the first n Fibonacci numbers.

Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .



Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Assuming n is set to 8 the following Fibonacci sequence should be displayed -> 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

Environment Setup:
Open New Terminal from VSCode
Create new project path using mkdir <appname>
Change the director cd <apppath>
Initialize npm package using npm init
And then provide the respective inputs and then press enter multiple times.
Install mocha and chai using npm install mocha chai --save-dev
Run the unit tests using npm run test
